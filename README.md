To publish new posts on your .github.io website using Jekyll, you will need to follow these steps:

Create your new post as a Markdown file in the _posts directory of your Jekyll project. The file should be named in the format YYYY-MM-DD-title.md, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, and DD is the day. For example, if you are creating a post on January 1, 2021, the file should be named 2021-01-01-title.md.

Add the front matter to your post. The front matter is a block of YAML code at the top of the file that specifies metadata for the post, such as the title, date, and categories. Here is an example of the front matter for a post:

Copy code
---
layout: post
title: "My First Blog Post"
date: 2021-01-01
categories: jekyll
---
Write the content of your post in Markdown format below the front matter. Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to format your text using easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text.

Commit your changes to the _posts directory and push them to your GitHub repository. This will trigger a build on the GitHub Pages server, which will generate your website using the Jekyll files from your repository.

Once the build is complete, your new post will be published on your .github.io website. You can view it by navigating to your website's URL in a web browser.

Note: If you are using a custom domain for your website, you will need to update your DNS settings to point to your GitHub Pages site. You can find more information about setting up a custom domain in the GitHub Pages documentation.
