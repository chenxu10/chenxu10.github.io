# Junior vs Senior Data Scientist

|                 | Junior                                                       | Senior                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ambition        | 1. Make no mistakes and make everything look good and compliant to best practice | 1. Build something new                                       |
| Process         | 1. Start to end is very random                               | 1. Among massive random trials, hide a structured bidirectional BFS+shortest search from end to start |
| Stage           | 1. All energy spent on modeling                              | 1. More energy spent on shipping and iterating               |
| Communication   | 1. Explain how sometimes with jargon                         | 1. Explain why, impact, cost in plain English                |
| Problem Scoping | 1. Greedy                                                    | 1. Start very small                                          |
| Evaluation      | 1. Only use one or two metrics<br/>2. Sometimes use vanity metrics and ignore counter-metrics | 1. Consider both explict and implict metrics, will use counter-metrics if necessary<br>2. Set metrics in advance not after the fact |
| Data            | 1. Never consider about sampling bias <br/>2. Lack the ability to scrape and handle unstructured data <br/>3. A lot of for loop or apply lambda function in pandas operations | 1. Am I introducing the bias when sampling <br/>2. Feel comfortable to use API to handle unstructured data<br/>3. Bit masking, vectorization in matrix operation, use matrix decomposition and multiplication to fasten the if else logic |
| Model           | 1. Follow the hottest trend                                  | 1. Start a simple model to get whole pipeline running<br>2. Leverage on the current working soluion |
| Deployment      | 1. Hardly think about it                                     | 1. Think about deployment from day one                       |
| Working Memory  | 1. Listen to the music, phone is next to your working table and open 20 windows at the same time | 1. Be very aware of working memory boundaries, phones shut down, at most three windows, use plain text as much as possible |
| Decision Making | 1. Decide based on probability                               | 1. Decide based on payoff, there's no such thing as data scientist 20 years ago, but there's trader, investor, hedger, and arbitarger 2 centuries ago. |
| Problem Solving | 1. Trial and error                                           | 1. Know mutiple heuristics(How to solve it?)                 |
| Reasoning       | 1. Inductive reasoning a lot<br>2.Have one hypothesis in head | 1. Use all deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning<br>2. Have at least two or even multiple competing hypothesis in head at the same time |
