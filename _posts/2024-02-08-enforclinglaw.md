Trading software and other commodities is not about the law but the enforcement of the law.

Every one knows about cut the loss and let the profit run(CLPR) law. 

But it's so hard and almost impossible to implement because 40,000 years of 
evolution wires us to fight back when we come across obstacles and take the profit win even the winning is small.

You as a trader in insurance and option business is not paid for being right, but how much you make when you are right.

Be aware what you are optimizing for. You should not be optimized for a static metric to measure your rate of progress, which is the first derivative speed but your rate of change, acceleration, which is higher order of derivative.

## Western Approach in Enforcing CLPR

TCR(test commit || revert) is an western approach to make decision in advance before you dive into a dangerous environment.

Just throw the key. Or Like Odysseus cages himself and asks every one to prision him before the voyage. Or you play violin with the song.

## Eastern Approach in Enforcing CLPR
In order to eliminate something, you should empower it first(将欲取之必先予之). You adopt a more mindful method, you first recognize and accept it.
You don't judge it, conceptualize it, or categorize it.

Then you become curious about it and investigate your breathing, muscle tension and relaxation and body posture. Finally you feel a sense of non-attachment and emptyness.

Explain to a million of people in a million ways in a specific and concrete way that make sense to him or her in the context.
