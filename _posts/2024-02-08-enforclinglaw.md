Trading software and other commodities is not about the law but the enforcement of the law.

Every one knows about cut the loss and let the profit run(CLPR) law. 

But it's almost impossible to execute because 40,000 years of 
evolution wires us to fight back when we come across obstacles and take the profit immediately even the winning is trival.

You as a trader in insurance business and am not paid for being right, but how much you make when you are right. Being right is just not enough and you have to be unconsensus right. It's okay to be concensus wrong.

Be aware what you are optimizing for. You must not be optimized for a static metric to measure your rate of progress, which is the first derivative speed, but your rate of change, acceleration, which is higher order of derivative.

## Western Approach in Enforcing CLPR

TCR(test commit or revert) is an western approach to make decision in advance before you dive into a dangerous environment like programming.

Just throw the key. Or Like Odysseus cages himself and asks every one to prision him before the voyage. Or you play violin with the song.

## Eastern Approach in Enforcing CLPR
In order to eliminate something, you should empower it first(将欲取之必先予之). You adopt a more mindful method, you first recognize and accept it.
You don't judge it, conceptualize it, or categorize it. Then you become curious about it and investigate your breathing, muscle tension and relaxation and body posture. Finally you feel a sense of non-attachment and emptyness.
