Don't go from statistics to probabilities, go from probabilities to statistics.

Simulate and visualize as a way to cheat if you cannot feel it.

Probability is not a mere computation of odds on the dice or more complicated variants; it is the acceptance of the lack of certainty in our knowledge and the development of methods for dealing with our ignorance.

No probabilities without ergodic, don't conflate ensemble probabilities with time probabilities, statistics can only calculate on one aggregation level more than you. Survival rate doesn't make sense on you as a person. It's a clinical problem.
