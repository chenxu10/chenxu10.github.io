# Junior vs Senior Data Scientist

If we treat each programming task as a transaction between our carbon-based brains and our silicon-based brains, we can combine the best practices of the centuries-old art of trading and the craft of programming.

The table below shows the corresponding relationship between risk management strategies and test-driven development principles:

|Risk management strategy|Example|Test-driven development principle|
|----------|----------|----------|
|Spread|Betting $5000 twice instead of $10000 at once|Refactoing test code to do the one thing|
|Diversification|Two people betting $5000 each instead of one person betting $10000|Unit tests need to be orthogonal and independent to minimize dependencies|
|Cut Losses and Stop Limit|The first rule never risk more than 2% of capital on any single trade,second if any single month the account loss more than 6%, stop trading for the rest of the moneth|Once a test fails, cut the corresponding production code ruthlessly and retreat to the previous state to rethink|
