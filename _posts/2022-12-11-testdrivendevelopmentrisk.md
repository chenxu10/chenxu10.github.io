# Why test has come to the first?
Test first is offensive and test later is defensive.

Test should aim small but aim widely high.

When testing you are using data to falisfy your hypothesis not proving it.

# What is a testable statement?

Good:The market will not go down more than 20% in the next 3 months is a testable statements. You can use data to falisfy your hypothesis, once you find one counterexample it's gone.

Bad:The market never goes down 20% in the past decade. This statement evern verified by quantified data doesn't make sense, because furture is a superset
of the past.
