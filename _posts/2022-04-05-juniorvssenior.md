|                 | Junior                                                       | Senior                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ambition        | 1. Make no mistakes and make everything look good and compliant to best practice | 1. Build something new                                       |
| Process         | 1. Start to end is very random                               | 1. Among massive random trials, hide a structured bidirectional BFS+shortest search from end to start |
| Stage           |                                                              |                                                              |
| Communication   |                                                              |                                                              |
| Problem Scoping |                                                              |                                                              |
| Evaluation      |                                                              |                                                              |
| Data            | 1. Never consider about sampling bias <br/>2. Lack the ability to scrape and handle unstructured data <br/>3. A lot of for loop or apply lambda function in pandas operations | 1. Am I introducing the bias when sampling <br/>2. Feel comfortable to use API to handle unstructured data<br/>3. Bit masking, vectorization in matrix operation, use matrix decomposition and multiplication to fasten the if else logic |
| Model           |                                                              |                                                              |
| Deployment      |                                                              |                                                              |
| Working Memory  |                                                              |                                                              |
| Decision Making |                                                              |                                                              |
| Problem Solving |                                                              |                                                              |
| Reasoning       |                                                              |                                                              |
