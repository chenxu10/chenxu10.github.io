1. I get a nice chunk of uninterrupted productive time at least for two hours(
    no email, no teams, no slack, no distractions).
2. I output sending out message becomes the top in others' mailbox.
3. I become more social, confident and better leader in the conversation starting at 
10:00. 
4. I make more friends because the peak activity with sunshine always happen from 11:00-13:00.
Lunch time is social time and walking time.
5. I stay away from the crowd, so that I keep the tranquility of my mind.
6. I can start to focus on my family, a much better dynamic balancing between work and family
make I less work alcholic.
7. The willpower is at the peak, so I can resist temptation to modern rubbish technology and 
move and meditate more often.
8. You produce first thing in the morning, so later you can eat better reading raw materials(math,
physics, life science, practioners' journal, history) with a purpose and your personal observation
and experience.
9. In any business,trading, and transaction, it's not what I know, but what I act on, and I act on
early, getting up at four make you act with an edge.
